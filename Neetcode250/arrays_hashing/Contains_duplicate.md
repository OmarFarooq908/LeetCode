### **Code Review and Comments**

#### **Positives**
1. **Clear Functionality**:
   - The function `hasDuplicate` is intuitive and straightforward, performing the task of checking for duplicates in a vector.

2. **Efficient Approach**:
   - Using `std::unordered_set` ensures that lookups and insertions are \(O(1)\) on average. This is efficient for detecting duplicates compared to a nested loop or other approaches.

3. **Good Use of STL**:
   - Leveraging `std::unordered_set` is a modern and idiomatic way to solve this problem in C++.

4. **Readable Code**:
   - The code is clean, with appropriate spacing and naming conventions, making it easy to understand.

#### **Areas for Improvement**
1. **Pass Vector by Reference with `const` (if possible)**:
   - The input vector is passed by non-const reference, which is unnecessary since the function doesn't modify the vector.
   - **Suggestion**: Use `const vector<int>&` for the parameter to make it clear the input will not be altered and avoid unnecessary copying if the caller passes a temporary vector.

2. **Use Range-Based Loops**:
   - Instead of manually iterating with an index, a range-based loop improves readability and reduces the risk of off-by-one errors.
   - **Suggestion**:
     ```cpp
     for (const int& num : nums) {
         if (seen.find(num) != seen.end()) {
             return true;
         }
         seen.insert(num);
     }
     ```

3. **Add Comments for Clarity**:
   - While the code is relatively simple, adding comments for beginners or collaborators helps maintainability.
   - **Suggestion**:
     ```cpp
     // Check if a vector contains duplicates
     bool hasDuplicate(const vector<int>& nums) {
         unordered_set<int> seen; // Stores unique elements encountered so far

         for (const int& num : nums) {
             if (seen.find(num) != seen.end()) {
                 return true; // Duplicate found
             }
             seen.insert(num); // Add to the set
         }
         return false; // No duplicates found
     }
     ```

4. **Error Handling for Empty Vector**:
   - Although not critical in this context, handling edge cases like an empty vector explicitly can enhance code robustness.

#### **Optimizations**
The current approach is already optimal for this problem, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and space complexity of \(O(n)\). However:
1. **If Input is Guaranteed to Be Sorted**:
   - If the vector is sorted, you can avoid using additional space and solve the problem in \(O(n)\) time using a single pass:
     ```cpp
     for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
         if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
             return true;
         }
     }
     return false;
     ```

2. **If Mutating the Vector is Allowed**:
   - If modifying the input vector is acceptable, you can sort it and then check for duplicates, reducing space complexity:
     ```cpp
     sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
     for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
         if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
             return true;
         }
     }
     return false;
     ```
   - This has \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity but reduces space complexity to \(O(1)\) if we ignore the sorting stack.

---

#### **Final Code After Suggestions**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if the vector contains duplicates
    bool hasDuplicate(const vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> seen; // Set to store unique elements

        for (const int& num : nums) { // Range-based loop for readability
            if (seen.find(num) != seen.end()) {
                return true; // Duplicate found
            }
            seen.insert(num); // Add the number to the set
        }
        return false; // No duplicates found
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2};
    cout << (solution.hasDuplicate(nums) ? "Duplicates exist" : "No duplicates") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

#### **Summary**
- The current code is efficient and functional, but passing by `const reference`, using range-based loops, and adding comments can enhance clarity and maintainability.
- For very large datasets, sorting-based approaches might save memory, but the trade-off is additional computational cost.
