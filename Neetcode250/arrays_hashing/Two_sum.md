### Code Review and Comments

The provided implementation is for solving the **Two Sum problem**, where the goal is to find two numbers in a vector that add up to a given target. The code is concise and efficient. Here's a detailed review of the code:

---

### **Strengths**
1. **Correct Use of `unordered_map`:**
   - The `unordered_map<int, int>` is used to store the numbers as keys and their indices as values. This ensures \(O(1)\) average time complexity for lookups and insertions.

2. **Efficient Logic:**
   - The algorithm calculates the complement of each number (`target - nums[i]`) and checks if the complement is already in the map. If found, it returns the indices immediately.
   - The solution runs in **\(O(n)\)** time, making it optimal for this problem.

3. **Compact and Readable Code:**
   - The code is straightforward and easy to understand, adhering to best practices for clean coding.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Returning an empty vector (`{}`) when no solution is found ensures the function behaves correctly for edge cases.

---

### **Suggestions for Improvement**
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Add a check to ensure the input vector has at least two elements. While not necessary for correctness, this improves robustness.
     ```cpp
     if (nums.size() < 2) {
         return {};
     }
     ```

2. **Naming Convention:**
   - `umap` can be renamed to something more descriptive, like `numToIndex`, to better convey its purpose.

3. **Handling Multiple Solutions:**
   - If multiple pairs can form the target sum, the current implementation returns only the first valid pair. If the problem requires handling all solutions, additional logic would be needed.

4. **Boundary Cases:**
   - Mention explicitly in the documentation or comments that the function assumes exactly one solution or no solution, as is typical for Two Sum problems.

5. **Add Comments for Clarity:**
   - Adding comments improves maintainability and helps others understand the logic.

### **Commented Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> numToIndex; // Map to store numbers and their indices
        int complement;

        // Iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            complement = target - nums[i]; // Calculate the complement

            // Check if the complement exists in the map
            if (numToIndex.find(complement) != numToIndex.end()) {
                return {numToIndex[complement], i}; // Return the indices
            }

            // Store the current number and its index in the map
            numToIndex[nums[i]] = i;
        }

        return {}; // Return an empty vector if no solution is found
    }
};
```

### **Edge Cases**
1. **Empty Input:**
   - `nums = []`, `target = 5`
   - Output: `{}`

2. **Single Element Input:**
   - `nums = [1]`, `target = 2`
   - Output: `{}`

3. **No Solution:**
   - `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `target = 7`
   - Output: `{}`

4. **Normal Case:**
   - `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
   - Output: `{0, 1}`

---

### **Complexity**
1. **Time Complexity:**
   - \(O(n)\): Each element is processed once (insertion and lookup are \(O(1)\) on average).

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - \(O(n)\): Space required for the `unordered_map`.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
The code is well-written and implements an optimal solution for the Two Sum problem. With minor improvements like better variable naming, input validation, and additional comments, it would be polished and production-ready.
