# Question
Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.

Return the array ans.

---

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]
Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]]
- ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]

---

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]
Output: [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3]]
- ans = [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

# Approaches

## Approach 1

The first approach is as following:
```
class Solution {
        public:
                vector<int> getConcatenation(vector<int>& nums) {
                        int n = nums.size();
                        vector<int> ans(2*n);
                        int counter = 0;
                        for (int i = 0; i < 2*n; i++){
                                ans[i] = nums[counter];
                                counter++;
                                if (counter == n){
                                        counter = 0;
                                }
                        }
                        return ans;
                }
};   
```

Here the time complexity is O(n). The approach can be optimized to O(n/2), by the use of hashmaps.

# Code Review
### **Code Review**

#### **Strengths**
1. **Functional Correctness**:
   - The code correctly implements the problem requirement of concatenating the array with itself.
2. **Readable Variable Names**:
   - Variables like `nums` and `ans` are meaningful and align with standard conventions.
3. **Consistent Coding Style**:
   - Indentation and braces follow a clear, consistent format.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

#### **Code Quality**
1. **Simpler Indexing**:
   - Instead of manually resetting `counter`, you can use modulo arithmetic to simplify the logic.
   - Modulo eliminates the need for an extra variable (`counter`) and reduces potential bugs in counter-reset logic.

2. **Initialization Optimization**:
   - While initializing `ans`, you use the constructor `vector<int> ans(2*n);`, which is good but can be made slightly more readable by using `resize`.

#### **Performance**
The current implementation is already efficient, with:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(2n)\) (Iterates over \(2n\) elements).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(2n)\) (Creates a new array of size \(2n\)).

However, the **loop logic** can be slightly improved for better readability and maintainability.

---

### **Optimized and Improved Code**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getConcatenation(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(2 * n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            ans[i] = nums[i % n];  // Use modulo for simpler logic
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

---

### **Key Improvements**
1. **Simplified Loop Logic**:
   - Using `i % n` directly replaces the need for the `counter` variable and conditional logic for resetting it.

2. **Cleaner Initialization**:
   - The initialization remains straightforward and efficient.

---

### **Why is the Optimized Code Better?**
- **Readability**: The modulo operation is intuitive and avoids manual counter handling.
- **Maintainability**: Less code and no risk of errors in manually resetting the counter.

---

### **Further Optimization**
If this code is run in a performance-critical scenario where memory allocations need to be reduced, consider using in-place operations (though not applicable if the return type must strictly match the problem constraints).
